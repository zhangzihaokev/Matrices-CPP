# Matrices in C
matrices.cpp contains C++ implementation of basic matrix vector operations like addition, scalar multiplication and matrix-matrix multiplication. 
Also included is a function that computes the QR decomposition of a square matrix A. Matrices are implemented as 1 dimensional arrays.
We use column major oder for storing matrices.
